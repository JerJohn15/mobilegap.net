# Mobilegap.net

### About
This GitHub repositary contains the pages of [www.mobilegap.net][1] site. MobileGap is the list of open source mobile applications, grouped by mobile platform. 

### Add your application
This repositary is the chance for you to submit your open source project for it to appear on MobileGap list. All you have to do is to issue pull request with the changes to **main.md** file (which contains all home page content). 

One thing we ask for submitters is to respect the order for new applications, its based on app name.

The actual website is being synched with GitHub every couple of weeks or so. Once [www.mobilegap.net][1] is synched with this repositary, your open source project will appear in the list.

Dont be shy and let other developer know about your open source mobile app!
