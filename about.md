# About MobileGap

MobileGap is an initiative to create a [useful list][1] of open sourced mobile application projects for popular smartphone platforms. This list helps app developers and designers to learn from popular open source projects. And sometimes to stop reinventing the wheel.

# Contribute to MobileGap

All the pages of [mobilegap.net][1] are also open sourced in [GitHub repository][2]. All you have to do in order to include your open source mobile application project is to issue pull request with the updated **main.md**. We sync pages in GitHub repo with the actual website couple times per month.

If you would like to contribute by doing short tech review for an app which is already on the list [ping us on Twitter][3].
